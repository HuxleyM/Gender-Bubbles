# Gender-Bubbles : a living interactive gender survey

This is a project I really care about. It frustrates me that gender is commonly confused with sex, as in gender : female or male (these are sexes not genders),so I decided id like to build a survey that everyone can fill out with there own gender identities, that you could see the scale of other people who also identified similiar to you as well as other identities you never knew! Therefore I made Gender Bubbles a living interactive gender identity survey, thats only validation is that of banning female/male responses.
